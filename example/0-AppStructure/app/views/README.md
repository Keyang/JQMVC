#Views

This folder contains most HTML code for views. For each view there should be 
one HTML file with same name stored in this folder. For example:

helloWorld.html

		<h1>Hello World</h1>
	 
In Javascript, mvc.view("helloWorld").show() will display above content.

Views could use data on the fly.
